      <p>If you want to download executable files or compiled mods instead of source code of them, here's the
        instruction how to do it for Github.</p>
      <p>First - make sure there is no "Official website" link exists on HL Sources page, which would look like this:
      </p>
      <p><img src="../images/official-website.png" id="img1">
      </p>
      <p>If there's no such link for your item - then go to github page of selected engine/mod (using main blue link),
        and then click on the link from the "Latest releases" section:</p>
      <p><img src="../images/download-releases.png" id="img2" title="Click on '* releases' link in the menu bar">
      </p>
      <p>This will open page with latest release. Click on one of the files for your platform (like win32 / win64 etc.)
        in Assets section to download it (choose one without Source code / Source / Src in its title).</p>
      <p><img src="../images/download-assets.png" id="img3"
          title="Click on one of the files in Assetes section of the release (if exists)"></p>
      <p>If there was no "Latest releases" section on the right column of github page from previous screenshot - it
        means there are no official releases on github yet, so you will need to either find compiled releases elsewhere,
        or compile it by yourself.</p>
